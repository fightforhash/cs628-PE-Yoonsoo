# MyResume

Input
The program takes a set of data provided in the form of JSX (React components) and CSS styles, specifically focusing on information related to an individual's resume. This includes details such as personal information, education history, work experience, skills, and projects. The data is hardcoded within the React components.

Process
The data is processed using React to dynamically render the information. React components, such as header, section, and ul, are used to structure the resume into different sections. Each section, such as "Education" and "Work Experience," is styled using CSS, which controls the layout, colors, and fonts to ensure the resume is visually appealing and legible. The React Resume component renders all the sections by combining HTML structure and CSS styles.

Output
The final output is a visually formatted resume displayed in a browser, showing the individual's information in a clean and organized manner. The resume content is responsive to screen size, ensuring it adapts well for different device views.
